# capstone-clouddevops

This project represents the successful completion of the last final Capstone project and the Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity.
What did I learn?

In this project, I applied the skills and knowledge I developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

    Using Circle CI to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
    Building pipelines
    Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
    Building Kubernetes clusters
    Building Docker containers in pipelines
    Working in AWS

Application

The Application is based on a python3 script using flask to render a simple webpage in the user's browser. A requirements.txt is used to ensure that all needed dependencies come along with the Application.
Kubernetes Cluster

I used AWS CloudFormation to deploy the Kubernetes Cluster. The CloudFormation Deployment can be broken down into four Parts:

    Networking, to ensure new nodes can communicate with the Cluster
    Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is used to create a Kubernetes Cluster
    NodeGroup, each NodeGroup has a set of rules to define how instances are operated and created for the EKS-Cluster
    Management is needed to configure and manage the Cluster and its deployments and services. I created two management hosts for extra redundancy if one of them fails.
