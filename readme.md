# Cloud DevOps Engineer Capstone Project

This project represents the successful completion of the last final Capstone project and the Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity.

## What did I learn?

In this project, I applied the skills and knowledge I developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:
- Using Circle CI to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Building pipelines
- Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
- Building Kubernetes clusters
- Building Docker containers in pipelines
- Working in AWS

## Application

The Application is based on a python3 script using <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a> to render a simple webpage in the user's browser.
A requirements.txt is used to ensure that all needed dependencies come along with the Application.
